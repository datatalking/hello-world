How to contribute
-----------------------

1. This started as a PM for sublime and the feedback has been amazing so I've morphed in feedback to https://github.com/khuyentran1401/Task-scheduler-problem
2. In addition the shaker TODO djangotodo tracker is being integreated (slowly) https://github.com/datatalking/django-todo
2. You can spread the word! A simple way to help is to share this project with others.


Feature / Language Requests
----------------

To get the feature you want more quickly there are options:

* The project is open source so it is easy to contribute, I should have a beta 4th quarter of 2021 (django permitting.)
